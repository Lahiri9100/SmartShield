🧪 Generate Demo Logs

Use the following command to generate fake but realistic logs:

```bash
python generate_fake_logs.py
```

This will create a file called `demo_network_logs.csv` with normal and suspicious patterns.

🖥️ Run the App Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run smartshield_app.py
```

📊 Sample Use Case

SmartShield helps IT administrators at colleges/offices:

* Identify abnormal login times
* Detect unusual data transfers
* Flag potential brute-force or data exfiltration events
* Visually monitor activity patterns with graphs
